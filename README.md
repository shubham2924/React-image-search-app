# ðŸš§ IMP NOTE:
The time a user is using this web app, many other users also might be using this app simulatneously so if images are not rendered then it is requested to wait for some time and visit app again as Unsplash API(trial-free mode) is used to fetch images.

## Some notable feature:
1) This is a PWA(progressive web app) react app which means user can just download the web-app on phone and use it like any other mobile app which uses [unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).
2) Provides notification when user's device gets disconnected from internet.
3) Provided [product tour](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-joyride) feature to let know user about the complete app.
4) Persistent dark mode.
5) Dedicated [drawer](https://material-ui.com/) section to search trending searches.
6) User can preview particular image, can download it, [share](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share) it on social media.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
